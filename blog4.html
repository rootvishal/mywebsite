                       <span>“It's a big world out there. It would be a shame not to experience it.”
― Jo Andrews<br></span>
                        Experience is a crucial factor for employers while deciding who gets their foot in the door. It’s strongly advised that students take the opportunity to complete a period of work experience to ensure they have a competitive advantage over their peers; and that’s where an internship can make all the difference.<br>
Internships can be as short as a week or as long as 12 months. They can be paid or voluntary.<br>
According to AICTE's draft internship policy and guidelines, engineering students will have to undertake mandatory of at least three internships during their four-year BTech programme from the current academic sessions.
<br><br>
                        With internship season at its peak, it’s not just private companies but the government is also stepping up its efforts to hire interns to get fresh ideas from engineering students.
To make it simpler for everyone we conducted an interview of a third-year student of VSSUT, Burla who would love to share his experiences that he learnt so far in the professional field as an intern.

  <span class="question">How did you get all your internships?</span><br>
I try to do internships by directly getting in contact with some of the working professionals in any company. I first try to search for any good company in which I want to do internships. Then I try to find out the contact details of their office or HR. Then contact them for internships directly through mails or calls and convince them to give me a chance to work with them as an intern.
<br><br>
					<span class="question">What are the ways of your internships online or offline?</span><br>
I have experienced both online and offline internships. some internships could be done both online and offline but some internships required to be done in offline mode only. Mostly core technical fields are required to be done in offline only but software field and management field could be done in both online and offline mode. Also, during this situation most works are done from home but many works are there which could be done from office only. For example, municipality offices and different regulatory bodies.

					<br><br>
					<span class="question">Which companies gave you internship opportunities? And how long it took to get response from company since you applied?</span><br>
I got internship opportunities from many good companies. First, I did an online internship in Unacademy where I used to make courses, review content and marketing of it. Then I worked under a professor of NIT Rourkela on designing course. During that period, I also took some courses on photography and robotics. Then I got an opportunity to work with UNICEF where we used to set up testing labs and bridge the gap between the local villagers and administration. We took some rural students and did experimentation on education. After that I applied through a proper letter to DRDO Hyderabad where I interned. Now currently I am in charge of the covid-19 control room of twin city CTC and BBSR.Here I manage the scheduled tests of all the suspects of twin city and communicate with different agencies. 
</p><div class="blog-image"><img src="assets/img/blog/blog402.jpg" style="max-height:220px"></div><p>
<span class="question">What are the skills required to get internships?</span><br>
					There are different types of internships from different fields. So, the skill set requirement for different internships is different. some basic skills which are commonly required for every internship, such as communication skills, Analytical skills and basic knowledge about your branch so that you could implement it on your own. Exploring and perform experiment on yourself should be the most important priority for all. Other important criteria are networking i.e. how you are using your own connections, because no matter how much skilled you are, you have to search your own relevant platform to learn, to polish and to implement your skills.
<br><br>
					<span class="question">What is the importance of grades for internships and what is the best time to do any internships?</span><br>
					No grades are not that important for internships except if you are applying for any research internships from  IITs OR NITs.<br>
The most important thing that matters is improve knowledge and experience by trying of getting yourself into internships from the very beginning of first year itself.

					<br><br>
					<span class="question">Was your internship paid or unpaid one? According to you which one is better?</span><br>
					I have done both paid internships and unpaid internships. What matters now is that you have to learn and grow, it doesn’t matter if it’s a paid or not. In terms of experience and knowledge, both are good. You will get enough work experience. The experience which you get will be immersive and this knowledge and experience will one day help you to get paid well. Now you are in the phase of learning so go for more unpaid ones as they are easy to get. As you gain more experience you can go for paid ones. 
</p><div class="blog-image"><img src="assets/img/blog/blog403.jpg" style="max-height:250px"></div><p>
					<span class="question">Tell us about the companies you had the internships? About mentors, projects, relations between mentors and interns.</span><br>
					I have worked for unacademy which helped me to get know about product marketing, consumer experience, consumer requirements and behaviour.<br>
Now currently I am working for the twin city BBSR and CTC municipal corporation. Here I learned work with many higher officials. To handle data and statistics of various information of this covid crisis. Here they guided me to manage various sector of helplines and emergency information. I learned many things by helping manage various information and data's in this current crisis.<br>
About the mentors, they are always very helpful and punctual, always cheering
<br><br>
					<span class="question">Are recommendations really necessary to get internship in any big reputed companies?</span><br>Everyone out there is applying for big reputed companies from IITs, NITs and even us because everyone wants to give it a shot and try their luck hard. So, a letter of recommendation makes it quite easier to get into this. Recommendation letter can either be from any employee working in the company or any member of our departments for example HOD. But recommendation are just the secondary things, first you must have great skills, knowledge and ability because this will only help you more to grow and get a good internship. Grades are quite necessary for research internships in IITs and NITs but other than that most companies just look after your skills, communication and ability to solve problems.<br><br>
					<span class="question">Any tips you want to give your juniors?</span><br>
					For my juniors I would like to say that explore yourself more and more and try to improve your skill and knowledge. And try to do internships from the first year itself of your B. Tech career.<br>
Keep in touch with your seniors always because they have been experiencing the phase you are. Hence you won’t be misguided and you will get a clear-cut idea what to do or what not to do. I personally learnt a lot of things from my seniors only. Thank you
							<br><br><span style="font-size:20px;text-align:center">And best of luck in your path of getting your dream job.</span>
