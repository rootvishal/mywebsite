                       <span>“People never learn anything by being told, they have to find out for themselves.”
― Paulo Coelho<br></span>
                        Experience is a crucial factor for employers while deciding who gets their foot in the door. It’s strongly advised that students take the opportunity to complete a period of work experience to ensure they have a competitive advantage over their peers; and that’s where an internship can make all the difference.<br>
Internships can be as short as a week or as long as 12 months. They can be paid or voluntary.<br>
According to AICTE's draft internship policy and guidelines, engineering students will have to undertake mandatory of at least three internships during their four-year BTech programme from the current academic sessions.
<br><br>
                        With internship season at its peak, it’s not just private companies but the government is also stepping up its efforts to hire interns to get fresh ideas from engineering students.
To make it simpler for everyone we conducted an interview of a third-year student of VSSUT, Burla who would love to share his experiences that he learnt so far in the professional field as an intern.
</p><div class="blog-image"><img src="assets/img/blog/blog301.jpg"></div><p>

  <span class="question">How did you get all your internships?</span><br>
After completing my 2nd year, I applied for some of companies through our college forms and then I got recommendations for those companies. But during the lockdown period as field(offline) internships were not possible so I applied for many online internships through Internshala, InternO, timesjob, dare2complete and got some contacts from LinkedIn. Hence, I got many opportunities as an intern.
<br><br>
					<span class="question">What are the ways of your internships online or offline?</span><br>
I have experienced both online and offline internships. There are different fields in which some internships could be done both online and offline but some field of work has to be done in offline mode only. <br>
For example, core technical fields could be done offline only but software field and management field could be done in both online and offline mode. Also, during this current situation there is a growth in urge for work for home. So, online is the best option now. Offline option gives us an experience of professional life but online internship also has its own benefits like it saves money, time and space. Also, today's growth in technology makes everything easier.
					<br><br>
					<span class="question">Which companies gave you internship opportunities? And how long it took to get response from company since you applied?</span><br>
I got two offline technical internships one from DRDO, Balasore and the other from CDAC, Pune. Two online non- technical internships from EduVoice and DeMeNew for two months each. The time to get any response from the companies totally depends on the number of applicants for that internship. The selection process takes some time and some companies even take interview either virtually or practically. But if you have recommendation from any known of yours from that company, it becomes easier for you and you get shortlisted soon. During this lockdown, if you apply for paid internship, the companies have a very common way to shortlist the applicants , like  first they select you  by your resume , then to know you better a telephonic interview  and at last a skype or google meet interview (may or may not). For unpaid internships the employers usually hire a lot of interns without taking any kind of interviews, they just go through your resume and shortlist accordingly. 
</p><div class="blog-image"><img src="assets/img/blog/blog302.jpg"></div><p>
<span class="question">What are the skills required to get internships?</span><br>
					There are different types of internships from different fields. So, the skill set requirement for different internships is different. But there are some basic skills which are commonly required for every internship, such as communication skills 
Analytical skills and basic knowledge about your branch so that you could implement it on your own. If you want to learn something then  do it. Exploring should be the most important priority for all. Other important criteria are networking i.e. how you are using your own connections, because no matter how much skilled you are, you have to search your own relevant platform to learn, to polish and to implement your skills.
<br><br>
					<span class="question">What is the importance of grades for internships and what is the best time to do any internships?</span><br>
					I don't think that grades are important for internships except if you are applying for big companies or research internships from IITs OR NITs.<br>
Some students out there get internship even they had backlogs. But that doesn't mean to secure backlogs in subjects, I am just talking about internships because your grades would be really important up to some extent when you apply for job interviews. <br>
And I would not suggest first years to go for internship as they hardly know anything about their branch. It's just a great time for them to explore new skills to find out in which field or branch they are really interested in. They should polish their skills, try to be perfect in one domain. Then from second year onwards they should start applying for internships.
					<br><br>
					<span class="question">What is the importance of grades for internships and what is the best time to do any internships?</span><br>
					I did some paid internships and some unpaid internships. Also, according to me if you are very good at some skills never do it for free. To reach at that stage you have to learn and you have to grow doesn’t matter it’s a paid or not. In terms of experience and knowledge, both are good. You will get enough work experience.  But the paid internships are slightly difficult to get selected in. If the company doesn't see any kind of contribution from your side why will they pay you for their project , that’s why they hire  very fine interns those who are committed and serious for their work .There are also some companies where you can pay for getting an internship which is quite awesome because they will teach you properly and as you are paying from your side ,so you have to be serious during the process . It is more of like a vocational training. So, in short in learning stage unpaid is better, so don’t waste your time to search the paid ones as its very difficult to get if you don’t have a proper efficient skill. After being skilled in a particular domain, go for the paid ones. You will definitely crack it.

					<span class="question">Tell us about the companies you had the internships? About mentors, projects, relations between mentors and interns.</span><br>
					I have done internships in two technical companies and two customer-based companies. The technical companies CDAC and DRDO helped me to gain good technical knowledge and completed some of their projects under them.  the customer-based companies EduVoice and DeMeNew helped me to get experience about product marketing, consumer experience, consumer requirements and behaviour.
About the mentors, they are always very helpful and punctual, always cheering. As they have Done many projects and tasks under the guidance of the mentors from different companies, they know how to deal in every situation. Real life implementations are always fun. I Learned a lot of things like how to deal with a normal business man and how to be in contact with big corporate leaders, how to build a good connection, how the things are being done in the corporate life.
<br><br>
					<span class="question">Are recommendations really necessary to get internship in any big reputed companies?</span><br>Everyone out there is applying for big reputed companies from IITs, NITs and even us because everyone wants to give it a shot and try their luck hard. So, a letter of recommendation makes it quite easier to get into this. Recommendation letter can either be from any employee working in the company or any member of our departments for example HOD. After the submission of recommendations, it's your skills, knowledge and grades which would let you get selected. Grades are quite necessary for PSUs like DRDO, BARC, IOCL, BHEL, GAIL etc. But the small companies or start-ups only require your skills. To get into a big product-based companies referral is very much important because they receive a copious of applications so by referral it is easy to get shortlisted for the proceedings.<br><br>
					<span class="question">Any tips you want to give your juniors?</span><br>
					For first years, explore new skills, study hard while enjoying every stuff and select skills which you are really interested in.<br>
For second years, start exploring and get a grip on a particular skill. start applying for internships and try to figure out the road map you should follow for the next. <br>
Last tip is that it's a good thing to have a backup, apply to both core and non-core branch, learn any programming language you feel comfortable with, one programming language is enough but you have to master that language. Keep in touch with your seniors always because they have been experiencing the phase you are. Hence you won’t be misguided and you will get a clear-cut idea what to do or what not to do. I personally learnt a lot of things from my seniors only. Thank you
