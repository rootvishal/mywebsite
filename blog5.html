                        The benefits of working for experience, or for pay, at your next internship.<br>
Choosing between a paid and unpaid internship may seem like a no-brainer, but there are several factors you should consider when making the decision. From your financial circumstances to the type of experience you’re looking to gain, finding the right internship should take into account both your current situation and your future goals. ensure they have a competitive advantage over their peers; and that’s where an internship can make all the difference.<br>
And if you’re ready to take a more in-depth look at other factors, we’ve come up with a list of questions to help you narrow down your options.
</p><div class="blog-image"><img src="assets/img/blog/blog501.jpg" style="max-height:200px"></div><p>

  <span class="question">What do you need to get out of the internship?</span><br>
If you really need a job that pays, your focus should be on either a paid internship or a non-internship opportunity. But if you have the resources to support yourself (or are able to get another job in addition to your internship) an unpaid internship may offer some perks that a paid one doesn’t. For example, many small companies don’t have the budgets to pay interns, but sometimes they can offer a lot more hands-on experience than larger companies.<br>
Like in Paid Internship The Brand name of a company matters however you will not get the maximum benefit of the internship learning experience. For example, if you are looking for a career in coding but you get a social media internship in a major FMCG company then you need to evaluate how the experience will affect your career. If Social Media is something you know you are not interested in then opt for something more desirable in a job role.
<br><br>
					<span class="question"> Which type of internship will be most helpful to your career path?</span><br>
If you’re nearing the end of your time in college, chances are you’ve already had an internship (or two) and you’re probably ready to take the next step towards your post-college career. In a recent survey, the National Association of Colleges and Employers noted that 65.4% of seniors who have paid internships on their resumes are more likely to get a job offer prior to graduation. If you want a paid internships but haven’t found any options, we’ve got several paid internships that might be right for you.<br>                                                                 On the other hand, if you’re a freshman or sophomore and are looking to gain experience in a specific field, you may consider unpaid internships that give you the chance to develop certain skills and build your resume. The good news: You’re more likely to land a paid internship with an unpaid internship under your belt.
</p><div class="blog-image"><img src="assets/img/blog/blog502.jpg" style="max-height:250px"></div><p>
<span class="question">Is there a possible future with the company?</span><br>
One of the best things about internships (both paid and unpaid ) is that they can lead to a full-time job with a company. In fact, the promise of landing a full-time job is one of the main reasons why students consider unpaid internships in the first place. The best way to find out if the company you’re considering interning with has a history of hiring interns is to ask directly. And if a company does frequently hire interns, they’ll usually tell you that during your interview. Paid internship certainly makes life easy for a student. You can earn some extra pocket money in the summer and save up for the rainy day in college. Bagging a paid internship also elevates your value during your placements and future job searches. <br><br>
                    
Choosing an internship is one of the most important decisions you can make important during your time in college, and having as much information as possible will help you pick the right one. The key is to know what you want and work with potential employers to find the best fit. And if you want more advice, don’t be afraid to reach out to former interns or employees who are alums of your school. They’ll have the inside scoop on the companies you’re considering and be able to tell you what they got out of the experience.</p>
